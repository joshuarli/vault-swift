# vault

Store secrets in the macOS Keychain and inject them into commands.

## Install

### From source

```bash
make install
```

This builds the release profile (whole-module optimization, stripped symbols), code-signs the binary, and installs to `~/usr/bin/vault`.

The first `make install` creates a self-signed code-signing identity named `Vault Signing` in your login Keychain (one-time setup) and imports it so only `codesign` can use it. Code-signing gives vault a stable identity so macOS stops prompting for keychain access on every rebuild.

### Store a secret

```bash
vault set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Prompts securely (echo disabled). Or pipe it in:

```bash
pbpaste | vault set OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Retrieve a secret

```bash
vault get OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Prints the value and nothing else. Safe for `$(...)`.

### Delete a secret

```bash
vault rm OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### List stored names

```bash
vault ls
```

Names only, never values.

### Run a command with secrets

```bash
vault OPENAI_API_KEY DATABASE_URL -- cargo run
```

Looks up `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` in the Keychain and injects them as environment variables.

Mix with literal values:

```bash
vault OPENAI_API_KEY RUST_LOG=debug PORT=8080 -- cargo run
```

No `--`, no exec:

```bash
vault OPENAI_API_KEY cargo run   # error: expected '--' before command
```
